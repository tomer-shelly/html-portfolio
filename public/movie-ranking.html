<h1>The Best Movies According to Tomer</h1>
<h2>This next list contains my top 3 picks.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>After</h3>
<p>
This is the first movie out of a series of 5 movies.<br />
It's a romantic movie telling the story about how 2 teenagers met at random,<br />
and started to fall in love despite the fact that one of them is in a commited relationship.<br /> 
The following movies continue the story as thier life complicates.
</p>

<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>
This is a movie about a person that got experimented on and became immortal yet hideously scarred,<br />
he sets out to track down the man who did this to him.<br/>
The best part about the movie is how funny it is and that the character is portrayed by one of my favorite actors, Ryan Reynolds.
</p>

<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>
The movie follows a dad that takes law into his own hands and the lengths he'd go to in order to bring home his missing daughter and her friend that disappeared.
